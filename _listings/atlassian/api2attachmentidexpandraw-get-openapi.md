  title: Jira Cloud API Get contents metadata for an expanded attachment
  description: "Returns the metadata for the contents of an attachment, if it is an
    archive. For example, if the attachment is a ZIP archive, then information about
    the files in the archive is returned. Currently, only the ZIP archive format is
    supported.  \n  \nUse this method if you are processing the data without presenting
    it in the UI, as this method only returns the metadata for the contents of the
    attachment. Otherwise, to retrieve data to present in the UI, use [Get all metadata
    for an expanded attachment](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-attachment-id-expand-human-get)
    which also returns the metadata for the attachment itself, such as the attachment's
    ID and name.  \n  \n**[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ)
    required:** None, however the calling user must have permission to view the issue
    that the attachment belongs to."

        This resource expects a multipart post. The media-type multipart/form-data is defined in RFC 1867. Most client libraries have classes that make dealing with multipart posts simple. For instance, in Java the Apache HTTP Components library provides a [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html) that makes it simple to submit a multipart POST.

        In order to protect against XSRF attacks, because this method accepts multipart/form-data, it has XSRF protection on it. This means you must submit a header of X-Atlassian-Token: no-check with the request, otherwise it will be blocked.

        The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains attachments must be "file"

        A simple example to upload a file called "myfile.txt" to issue REST-123:

        curl -D- -u admin:admin -X POST -H "X-Atlassian-Token: no-check" -F "file=@myfile.txt" http://myhost/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-123/attachments

        ### About permission schemes and grants

        A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.

        #### Holder

        The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the _Administer projects_ permission is granted to a group named _Teams in space administrators_. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

        *   `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
        *   `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.

        The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):

        *   `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
        *   `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Manage application access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-application-access-744721629.html) for more information.
        *   `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
        *   `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
        *   `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
        *   `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
        *   `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
        *   `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
        *   `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
        *   `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID).
        *   `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).

        #### Permissions

        The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.
